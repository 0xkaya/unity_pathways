# Unity Essentials 

## Overview
This repository contains the projects and exercises completed as part of the **Unity Essentials Pathway**. Each project demonstrates a foundational skill in Unity, from understanding the Editor to creating 2D and 3D experiences, integrating audio, and preparing projects for publication.

## Completed Missions

1. **Editor Essentials**  
   - Learned the layout and functionality of the Unity Editor, including Scene and Game views.  
   - Used the Hierarchy and Inspector to manage and customize game objects.  
   - Explored asset importing, project organization, and working with the Project window.  

2. **3D Essentials**  
   - Created 3D scenes with interactive objects, understanding concepts like transforms and object manipulation.  
   - Applied Unity’s physics system, including rigidbodies and colliders, to bring realism to objects.  
   - Utilized lighting tools to enhance visuals, including directional, point, and spotlights.  

3. **Audio Essentials**  
   - Integrated audio clips into scenes using Audio Sources and Listeners.  
   - Configured spatial audio to create immersive soundscapes.  
   - Experimented with audio effects like pitch and volume adjustments for dynamic feedback.  

4. **Programming Essentials**  
   - Learned the basics of C# scripting within Unity, including variables, methods, and event systems.  
   - Implemented interactivity such as player movement, object behavior, and event handling.  
   - Debugged and optimized scripts to enhance gameplay functionality.  

5. **2D Essentials**  
   - Built 2D scenes using sprites and implemented sprite animations for dynamic visuals.  
   - Used the tilemap system to design 2D levels efficiently.  
   - Applied 2D physics for realistic interactions, including collisions and movement.  

6. **Publishing Essentials**  
   - Learned how to prepare and optimize projects for deployment on various platforms, including web and standalone builds.  
   - Configured build settings to ensure compatibility and performance.  
   - Gained an understanding of version control and best practices for maintaining project integrity.  

## Lessons Learned
- Gained a strong foundation in Unity’s core tools and features.
- Explored both 2D and 3D development workflows.
- Created projects ready for further refinement and expansion.
